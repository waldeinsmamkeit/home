    <h1>Golden Sunsets</h1>
    <p>Evenings by the ocean are magical, especially when the sun dips below the horizon, painting the sky in hues of gold and orange. 
    The gentle waves reflect the vibrant colors, creating a mesmerizing scene.</p>
    <p>As I sat on the sandy shore, I could feel the warmth of the sun's last rays. 
    The sound of the waves crashing and the sight of seagulls flying overhead added to the tranquil ambiance.</p>
